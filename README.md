### Reflection
Context: Show a simple example to demonstrate some level of proficiency with React, Javascript, JSX, Bootstrap, SASS.

My main challenges was having to quickly get back into the swing of things without having much time to spare.
Although the project looked extremely simple it has been 10+ years since ive touched a line of code and i've never really used anything in this project before. So i had a lot to learn in a short amount of time.
Obstacles were being inbetween computers at them moment using a very old and SLOW laptop and many errors both with ESlint dependancy issues with VS Code and obviously lots of syntax errors.

Create react app was used initially to build out the project as that seemed like a pretty easy logical start.

In the next iteration ... i would love to get the opportunity to continue rapidly increasing my knowledge with these technologies. Although delivered this a lot later than i planned i hope it demonstrates that i'm a committed hard worker, whose serious about getting back into IT and quickly getting up to speed so i can be a valuable member of your team!

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
